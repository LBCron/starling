# Third-party notices: model-pipeline

The release evaluation sets under `protected/*/release/` and `protected/release-shared/` contain excerpts of the public datasets below, selected by pinned procedures (each set's `SOURCE.md` names the exact revision, digest and selection script; the `reference/stable/` scripts it names are not in this tree). They are evaluation data, not part of any shipped package. Each keeps its own license; where that differs from this repository's MIT OR Apache-2.0, the directory says so in its `LICENSE` file.

## FFmpeg builds (fetched by the video gates, not in this repository)

`reference/embeddinggemma2/fetch_eg2_ffmpeg.sh`, `tools/release-gates.sh` and `tools/ci/runpod-cuda-pod.sh` download two FFmpeg shared builds, n8.1.3-17-gc389840894 and n9.0.2-28-g669f5ab083, from `Starlinghq/ffmpeg-lgpl-rebuilds` on Hugging Face, commit `caf396f176296fc12620c18a344a31f628a4613a`. `reference/embeddinggemma2/build_eg2_ffmpeg.sh` built them from pinned sources. Each is FFmpeg (LGPL 2.1 or later; no `--enable-gpl`, no `--enable-version3`) with one external library, dav1d 1.5.4 (commit `54706fc6bc0cdecab7e9593974a4039cc038fca7`, BSD-2-Clause), linked statically; FFmpeg has no software AV1 decoder of its own. The dataset holds the two archives, the source of FFmpeg at both commits and of dav1d, the configure lines and the build script. Each archive carries the licence texts in `LICENSES/`. The earlier BtbN builds are no longer used by the gates; the BtbN GPL build used to generate the synthetic spike videos is not hosted anywhere here. No package contains these builds.

## Converted model graphs

The reference scripts below convert upstream model weights into graphs that Starling hosts on Hugging Face. The graphs are not in this tree; each hosted repository carries the upstream license and the notice named here, which lists the modifications (Apache-2.0, section 4(b)).
